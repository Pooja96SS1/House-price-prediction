 Abstract
 
 Data is at the heart of technical innovations, achieving any result is now possible using predictive models. Machine learning is extensively used in this approach. Machine learning means providing  dataset and further on predictions are based on that, the machine itself learns how much importance a particular event may have on the entire system based on its pre-loaded data and accordingly predicts the result. Various modern applications of this technique include predicting stock prices, predicting the possibility of an earthquake, predicting company sales and the list has endless possibilities . For our research project, we have considered Mumbai as our primary location and are predicting real-time house prices for various localities in and around Mumbai. We have used parameters like 'square feet area', 'no. of Bedrooms', 'No of Bathrooms', 'Type of Flooring', 'Lift availability' ,'Parking availability' ,'Furnishing condition'. We have taken into account a verified dataset with diversity so as give accurate results for all conditions. We have used various algorithms explained below in various combinations and the weight for each algorithm is given based on the accuracy percentage. After evaluating for various test runs we conclude that instead of an individual algorithm a series of algorithm yields better results.
 
 
 
 Introduction

This article refers together with latest Forecast on Research predictions considering trends to further plan their economics. The main motivation of the project FORECASTING VARIATIONS ON HOUSE PRICE was to make the best possible prediction of house prices by using appropriate algorithms and finding out which among them is best suitable for predicting the price with low error rate. This is an interesting problem because most of the people will eventually buy/sell a home. This problem allows us, as house price analysts, to learn more about the housing market and helps with making more informed decisions. The analysis that were done in this paper is mainly based on the datasets of Vijayawada, A.P. because of unexpected changes in price of houses in and around Vijayawada due to emergence of new capital city Amaravati because of formation of new state.


Proposed System 

Proposed System Our dataset comprises of various essential parameters and data mining has been at the root of our system. We initially cleaned up our entire dataset and also truncated the outlier values. Further, we weighed each parameter based on its importance in determining the pricing of the system and this led us to increase the value that each parameter withholds in the system. We shortlisted 3 different machine learning algorithms and tested our system with different combinations that can guarantee best possibly reliability of our results [9]. Even after that, we followed a unique approach to increase the accuracy, our survey led to a conclusion that the actual real estate value also depends on nearby local amenities such as railway station, supermarket, school, hospital, temple, parks etc. And now we propose our unique approach that can counter this need. We use Google maps API and based on locality search we narrow down on a radius of 0.5 km. Now if we find any such public places in the circle we increase the value of the property correspondingly. We carried this out with manual examples and this gave us tremendous results in terms of accuracy in prediction


 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT 

The accuracy of the system can be improved. Several more cites can be included in the system if the size and computational power increases of the system. Furthermore, we can integrate different UI/UX methodology for better visualization of the results in a more interacting way using Augmented Reality [11]. Also, a learning system can be created which will gather users feedback and history so that the system can display the most suitable results to the user according to his preferences.
